\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
Spaceship System Sabotage is an independent and self-contained system that simulates a spaceship. The typical user experience with this application is to keep the system operating for as long as possible so that after a specified period of time the space craft will "reach its intended destination" and the user will reach an end state through a win condition. This perspective on the interaction of sub-systems will make the application feel more like a game than it does a simulation. When a sub-system is triggered with a stimulus leading to a sub-system failure, the application will tell the user that one of the crew members of the ship has sabotaged a sub-system. This acts as a challenge for the user to keep the crew members alive but attempt to determine who the defector of the crew is, providing "lore" and context for the simulated sub-system failure so that the user has motivation to keep the system functional.

\subsection{Product Functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user will be able to start a simulation of a system
\item The different sub-systems will be displayed for the user
\item The user will be able to switch views to choose the sub-system they are observing
\item The system will allows the user to combine views
\item Messages/alerts will be displayed for the user
\item The sub-systems will be able to receive stimulus from the application to prompt a status change
\item The sub-systems will be able to affect other sub-systems depending on their status
\item The user will be able to input a stimulus that will have a specified effect on a sub-system, namely a status change back to the original state
\item The user will be able to pause/resume the system
\item The simulation will be able to reach an end state at any time and terminate the simulation
\item The user will be able to end the simulation at any time if they so choose
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics}
The intended user of this application is anyone who enjoys games or challenges and has a basic understanding of systems and how they can interact. No previous work or school experience with designing systems is required as this application is not a test on the user's understanding of software architecture. This application aims to provide a casual experience of simulating the negative effects of sub-systems failing in a larger system and allows the user to have a role in this scenario regardless of failure or not. Each end state is an acceptable level of completion in terms of the simulation as they both result in a demonstration of the interaction between sub-systems. This means that the application is accessible to anyone from casual players in elementary school to Dr. Khedri while he's killing time waiting for his TAs to mark these deliverables.

\subsection{Constraints}
The limitations of this project come in the form of development time. The allocated amount of hours that we intend to dedicate to this project are in negative correlation with the amount of other school work we have to do during the timeframes of each deliverable. We would love to make this a full fleshed out game that is fun and challenging but at the moment we do not have the time to comfortably meet the requirements of the project and introduce enough additional features to make this a fun to play, sellable game. The rubric specified by the TAs will first and foremost be followed, and only then can additional features be added.
\\Another limitation of this project would be the programming language chosen for the application. Depending on what language the development takes place in, certain features would be more difficult to implement in the amount of time given. For example, our team is more experienced in Java and may be more proficient in meeting the functional requirements with this language but it may be harder to meet the non-functional requirements, especially in terms of visual interfacing compared to working in a language like C++.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
The assumptions in the requirements section of this document are focused around the intended interface of the application. The proposed layout of the visual interface is that the sub-systems will be laid out in a representation of their location in physical space, meaning that there will appear to be a space craft in the user's view and all of the stimulus will be inputted through this apparent view. This also means that sub-systems will be layered on top of each other and will be difficult to view all at once, hence the requirement that the uer will be able to change views and customize the sub-systems being displayed at one time.

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
Some non-functional requirements that could take too long to implement and are not explicitly required for a functional demonstration may be delayed until later versions of the application. Some areas of development that this is a concern for are the low loading times and "clean" interface.
%In version 1.1 we'll include a game mode where the creators of FTL sue us

\section{Functional Requirements}
