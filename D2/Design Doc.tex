\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
\tab The Large System Design document is responsible for the high level architecture design of the system and the results produced from this analysis will be utilized in the design phase. The document is derived from the requirements and specifications of the overall system, determined in the previous software requirement specification document. The intended audience of the document is mainly for the developers who will be utilizing the large system design document to understand the overall design of the program to help structure the responsibilities assigned to each class. Developers who are maintaining the program may also use the document to ensure new additions to the program follow the system design properly to ensure a smooth experience for the user.
% End SubSection

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
\tab Space system sabotage is a simulation of a fictional spaceship that is travelling to a pre-determined location in a fixed amount of time. The user will interact with the system through random events based on a function of the running time of the simulation. Random events will involve negative situations that occur, such as comets damaging the ship or part of the ship being sabotaged, where the user will have to respond to fix them in a timely manner with a selection of tools. If successful, the space ship continues toward its goal but if an incorrect solution was chosen then the problem is spread to other systems. If enough events happen with incorrect solutions to them, then the space ship will slowly spiral out of control and the user will fail the simulation. This system offers an entertaining environment to the user where they will be challenged to keep the spaceship intact until it dock import at the space station.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
\tab The rest of the Large System Design document is separated into four sections, the first being the use case diagram. This diagram models the functionality of the system using actors, the users of the system, and use cases of the system. The next section is the analysis class diagram which describes the key classes of a system and their interrelationship through boundary class, entity classes, and controller classes. These classes of the system are identified by extracting through the description of the use case descriptions.  Section three should provide an overview of the overall architectural design of the application where the division of the system into subsystems follows high cohesion and low coupling. Last section is the Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) cards on the classes in the analysis class diagram where each card identifies and assigns responsibilities to classes required to build the system. After these four sections there is an appendix that includes the division of labour.

\section{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:architectural_design}
% Begin Section

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
\tab The overall architecture utilized in this project is the presentation-abstraction-control (PAC) architecture, essentially a hierarchical structure made out of model-view-controller (MVC) blocks. PAC architecture is an interaction orientated software architecture that was developed from MVC to support the application requirement of multiple agents in addition to the interactive application requirements. Each agent has a control module that plays an active role, where the model and view module are separated which entails the sub-system architecture. The multiple agents are ordered in a hierarchy where the controller components communicated in a well-structured method. It is very suitable for any distributed system where each remote agent has its own functionalities with data and interactive interface. \\ \\
\tab With the analysis class diagram, it was determined that the architecture needed to follow high coupling and low cohesion design principle with a requirement of sub-systems to be able to be easily detached from the overall system. By striving to implement the first design principle mentioned coupled with exploring the ways the user will be able to utilize the system, it became clear that structure similar to MVC would be utilized to create the architecture of the program. With self-contained modules that can be easily detached from the system needed to fulfill user requirements, it became apparent that some sort of hierarchical system would be utilized where small units of MVC sub-systems can be added and removed when needed. Clearly the PAC 	architecture is well suited for this system where it allows multi-viewing of agents, easy to plug in new agent or replace existing agent.

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
\item The power subsystem controls all of the all of the interactions that relate to the simulated amount of electrical power in the system and is dependent on the main controller. This subsystem can "malfunction" and must be stimulated to return to base state.
\item The oxygen subsystem controls all of the interactions that relate to the simulated amount of air in the system and is dependent on the main controller. This subsystem can "malfunction" and must be stimulated to return to base state.
\item The mechanical subsystem controls all of the interactions that relate to the simulated physical moving parts in the system and is dependent on the main controller. This subsystem can "malfunction" and must be stimulated to return to base state.
\item The tool subsystem controls all of the interactions that will "fix" the other simulated subsystems and return them to normal state.
\item The menu subsystem controls all interactions outside of the play session and will allow the user to perform actions such as pausing, resuming, or quitting the play session.
\item The main controller subsystem is the main hub of interaction between all other subsystems and will appropriately stimulate each subsystem at the correct time. This subsystem receives input from all other subsystems and returns the output back to each system to determine what will happen in the simulation.
